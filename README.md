# NAMY – AI Emotional Support Bot

**NAMY** is a gentle AI assistant designed to provide emotional support, comfort, and a non-judgmental space to talk. It was created using prompt engineering to simulate a caring, empathetic listener who responds with kindness, calm energy, and helpful reflection.

## 💡 Why This Project
The world can be overwhelming. Sometimes all people need is someone to talk to. Even a digital presence that listens without judging and offers a kind word. This project explores how language models like ChatGPT can fill that role safely and respectfully.

## 🛠️ Features
- Asks how the user feels and listens
- Validates emotions (without giving medical advice)
- Offers a comforting message
- Suggests a small activity (e.g. deep breathing, journaling, a cup of tea)

⚠️ *Disclaimer: NAMY is not a therapist. It’s a virtual comfort assistant for light emotional support.*
